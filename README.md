# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
I was tasked with  creating a game of tic tac toe using python.
The game can be successfully played and lasts 9 rounds.
There are some holes within the code that will be worked on to make sure the game can be played no matter the value entered and if the value has aleady been entered.
